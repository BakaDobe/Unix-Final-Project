## VPS installation
- Go to [ionos.ca/servers/vps](https://ionos.ca/servers/vps) and select the $1/month plan
- This is the cheapest and best option for our project with 512MB RAM, 10GB SSD and a 1vCore CPU
- For "System and version management system", pick Debian 11
- Make sure the "Data center location" is on United States and you select any Cloud Backup
- Before you can checkout, create your account and provide your personal information (email, phone number, address, etc..)
- After the purchase, log into your newly created account and go to "Servers & Cloud"
- Here you will find the server's IP address, the default username and password(you can change this once in the server), the server's status and which port they can connect to

## Putty installation
- Go to putty.org to download both PuTTy (a SSH and telnet client) and PuTTYGen (creates SSH keys)
