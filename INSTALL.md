## VPS installation
- Go to [ionos.ca](https://ionos.ca/servers/vps) and select the $1/month plan
- This is the cheapest and best option for our project with 512MB RAM, 10GB SSD and a 1vCore CPU
- For "System and version management system", pick Debian 11
- Make sure the "Data center location" is on United States and you select any Cloud Backup
- Before you can checkout, create your account and provide your personal information (email, phone number, address, etc..)
- After the purchase, log into your newly created account and go to "Servers & Cloud"
- Here you will find the server's IP address, the default username and password(you can change this once in the server), the server's status and which port they can connect to

## Putty installation
- Go to [putty.org](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to download both PuTTy (a SSH and telnet client) and PuTTYgen (creates SSH keys)
- We chose the 64-bit x86 option because our machines met those requirement

## SSH Keys
- An easy way to create a public and private SSH key is with PuTTYgen
	- First things first, make sure that the type of key to be generated is on "RSA" and that the number of bits is "4096"
	- Press "Generate" and the key will do so
	- Copy the public key in the display box and save it in Notepad to use later
	- To make the key secure, add a passphrase(password) and once you're done, save it as a private key and give it a name
- You can now close the key generator

## Accessing Remote Server
- To access the remote server, you'll need to open PuTTY
	- Paste the server's IP address where it says "Host Name (or IP address)"
	- Make sure the port is on 22 and that the connection type is on "SSH with Telnet selected"
	- Press Open and follow what the popup says
	- Enter the username (the one provided by ionos) when asked, then press enter
	- Enter the default password (the one provided by ionos) when asked (it's normal for the screen to remain the same even though you're typing), press enter when you're done
