Part I: Final project proposal 


1. Project description/goals: Our goal for this team project is to get a complete knowledge of how the desktop environment we choose works because it's going to be a new discovery for all of us. Succeeding in the creation of a VPS, and understanding how it works precisely and the process it since basic system security is required.

2. Platform of choice: Using Virtual Box VM on our Windows OS, using LXDE as a desktop environment, the Debian server distribution.

3. Requirements: We are hoping to accomplish everything on the list, for the creation of multiple user accounts, we already know how to do it, there was an entire lab for this. To continue, for the process or service management, we will take a look at the labs we did that regards this matter and look up things on the internet and use them as a reference while keeping our originality. For the basic system security, we would proceed in doing so with a VPS and make sure that it is indeed secure and the automated tasks with the script language, we can go through the labs we did during the semester and take a look at the script files to help ourselves out and use the internet as a reference while keeping the originality of our script file(s).

4. Major technical solutions compared: We are aiming to reach every step we do with the labs we did during the semester that regard the points that we are supposed to integrate into our scenarios to see if it is better than the past labs or needs improvement, or for example compare our VPS to a good decent VPS on a youtube video to see if we are doing well and improve it as we go along.

5. Timeline: For the first week, we are planning on focusing on the creation of the multiple user accounts and the service management, working on it for at least 2 hours a day. Proceeding on the second week, we would like to focus on the security of the system and make sure that our VPS functions well and is as secure as possible. For the third week, we will focus on the script files and make sure that the script files are well done (make them perform the automated tasks that we want). The extra week is for us to finalize our project, add anything that might be missing and of course, prepare for the presentation.

6. Team composition: Anthony Mastronardi, DÃ© Andre Powell McKain, and Ibrahim Awad

Clarifications:
Our goal needs to be clearer: To put it simply, we want to make a decent web server that 
functions well, to us this project is about applying what we learned so far in the labs and at the 
same time still discovering and learning through this project, so this goal is a decent good one 
we gave ourselves.
